# 📅 Meetings

### ☕️ Discord Cuppa and Chill

We meet once a week for coffee for whoever is open and interested or whoever fancies a chat!

### 🎲 Server Events

As we don't want to wait for our next offsite to spend some quality time together and sparkle our days, we're trying to organise team events on a regular basis.

### 🤝 Weekly Syncs

We meet on a weekly basis and sync between our cycle teams and the company as a whole.

### 🌍 TownHall Meetings

Every few months we should host town hall metings to get an overview on the player base and to keep everyone addressed of Road Map of the Server and any and all Server and Community Development.
